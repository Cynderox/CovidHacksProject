There should be two folders: API and Web

API is where all of the backend data processing things should go. The api.py is the a barebones API that will communicate with the website.
My hope is to essentially have it import one "main" method from a file that will do all the processing, and return an object that contains all the data we need. 

Web is where the web app's source code lives. Theres not much to do with this until we know what we want it to look like.
